The moment.js has plenty of features and these examples are just the tip of the iceberg of what moment.js can do.
Just remember, in {{moment method=null}} means moment().method() and {{moment somedate method="something"}} means moment(somedate).method("something"). Also, the handlebars syntax does not let you pass some values (like arrays and objects) directly from the tag, so you may need to use the yaml frontmatter to run those.
