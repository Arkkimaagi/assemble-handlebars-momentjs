assemble-handlebars-momentjs 0.0.1
==================================

Combines the powers of Assemble, Handlebars.js and Moment.js into a great helper to master time.

# Crash course

Install these with npm:
* grunt
* assemble
* moment
* lodash

Get your assemble project running, drop the helper from src/helpers/ to your project directory, enjoy.

# Using this repository

Just download, run
```
npm install
```
and then test out generating src/index.html.hbs to build/index.html with:
```
grunt
```
Hopefully an updated version of index.html will be generated for you.

# Examples

These are in the frontmatter, these are not needed, but I use them as an example:
```
---
sampledate: <%=new Date("Sun Jun 30 2011 01:53:23 GMT+0300 (EEST)")%>
sampletextdate: 'Sun, 30 Jun 2012 11:19:15 +0300'
inputformats: ["ddd, DD MMM YYYY HH:mm:ss ZZ", "MMMM YYYY"]
daysadd: {days: 5}
fiveyearsago: {years: 5}
duration: {hours: 2, minutes: 33}
--- 

```

```
```
The event will last 3 hours
```

The moment.js has plenty of features and these examples are just the tip of the iceberg of what moment.js can do. Just remember, ```{{moment method=null}}```  means ```moment().method()``` and ```{{moment somedate method="something"}}``` means ```moment(somedate).method("something")```. Also, the handlebars syntax does not let you pass some values (like arrays and objects) directly from the tag, so you may need to use the yaml frontmatter to run those.
